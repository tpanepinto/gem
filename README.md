General Education Method

Goal: This is an open source project to teach people useful programming & related skills to assist in acquiring a job.

Key emphasis to achieve the goal:

1.  Working in a team.

2.  Working on code that becomes a product, that is actually used by people.

3.  Marketing (See below) married to Technology.

4.  Good Software praticies:

      (A) Coding Standards; with strong empahsis on: clear & concise code;

      (B) Customer Specifications & Architecture Documents;

      (C) Code Reviews;

      (D) Umit Testing & Continous testing;

      (E) Full Code Coverage.

5.  Integrating Open Source Software

      NOTE: Creating products in 2017, is much more about integrating open source software that writing your own software.

6.  Python Language

7.  Methodologies:

    (A)  GEM (General Education Method)

    (B)  VPE (Vision, Plan, Execute).

    (C)  EAPI (Entreprenuership, Administration, Production, & Integration).

Of the above points, points #1 & #2 are considered the most critical by this project to have useful programing & related skills to assist in acquiring a job.

The most improtant word is also 'Product':

    The goal is not to create software; but to create a product.
    This is an essential skill that will be valued by employers.

To properly drive home the value of product, rather than just software alone, the Snake project is dedicated to Peter Drucker, and takes the following statement as its motto:

“Because the purpose of business is to create a customer, the business enterprise has two–and only two–basic functions: marketing and innovation. Marketing and innovation produce results; all the rest are costs. Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.” - Peter Drucker

Purpose: The purpose of the Snake project is to teach people useful programing & related skills to assist in acquiring a job.

  Yes, the purpose is aligned with the goals of the project ;)

Vision: The vision of the Snake project is to teach people useful programing & related skills to assist in acquiring a job.

  And, yes, the vision is also closly aligned with both the goals & the purpose of the project ;-P

  Aligning the goals, purpose & vision is important.  Yes, Really!  (See point below on 'Integration').

As second inspiration for the Snake project is Ichak Adizes and his methodology of looking at organizing.  It's basicaly a four-fold model:

  Entrepenuership - Your emotions -- what you desire to do.  The purpose.

  Administration.  Boring, but neccessary.  Hold's everything together.

  Production.  Actually producing what you want to create.

  Integration.  Aligning & connecting Entrepeneurship, Administration & Production, so they work together as an integral unit.

  How this applies to the Snake project will become clearer as the project develps & will help guide the growth & acceptance of the Snake product by many people.

IMPORTANT CAVEAT:

    There is no plan to make money with this project, this is a teaching project.

    However, it will not make the mistake of many open source projects, of great software that languishes due to a lack of emphasis on product emphasis, or marketing.

    The emphasis on "business" & how to do this properly is *NOT* to make money, but instead to "teach people programming so as to get aquiring a job".

    This business emphasis is deliberatly chosen for this reason to "help teach", it is not chosen to make money.
